# Frameworks

We agree that it should not be a hassle to connect your framework with an external library.
That is why HylianShield will provide bridges, bundles and service providers to connect your
framework of choice with HylianShield validators.

## Scheduled

Currently we do not support any direct integration, but the following frameworks are scheduled on short notice.

- [Symfony2](http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/validation/custom_constraint.html) and [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/doc/providers/validator.html)
- [Laravel4](http://laravel.com/docs/validation#custom-validation-rules)
- [ZendFramework2](http://framework.zend.com/manual/2.3/en/modules/zend.validator.writing-validators.html)

The frameworks listed above have been researched and we are certain we can provide a complete integration.
Luckily, most frameworks actually encourage us to make the bridge.
